1.Which features does Java have to make it platform-independent?
Basically javac compile the code and generate the byte code file, which can be used any other platform but the JVM is a platform dependent



2.What is JVM, JRE, JDK
Java virtual machine(JVM) is specification or formulated documentation how to write a program, how to generate a byte code, how to load bytecode, how to execute bytecode, how to verify bytecode.

JRE(Java Runtime Environment) Combination of jvm and libraries that means all the documented files are implemented into the libraries.

JDK(Java Development Tool) Is a complete software having JVM,JRE.Libraries and Javac that's helps to generate a java code, In short it is combinations of all the documentations, source files, libraries and compiler.


3.What is main features of Java

1.Memory Management - Java has a garbage collectors, that works automatically,  when the objects is not pointed any references or null at that moment garbage collect remove the object.
2.Pointer - Java handled the pointers implicitly we dont need to handle it.
3.Platform Independent - After the compilation of source code we can bytecode run any other platforms.
4.Object Oriented language

4.How many time we can re-write a main method?

public static void main(String[] args)
public static void main(String []args)
public static void main(String[] array)
public static void main(String... args)

5.What is the use of String[] arg in main method

We can pass the externally values according to need

6.Why Java is not purely object oriented language
Because primitive variables, static opener that is not belong to object, but has a features wrapper classes using that we can used primitive variables as objects.

7.What is type-casting?

Convert the values into another types of data, having a 2 types - Implicit (Perform a automatically type casting means that small type values converted into large type of values).
                                                                  Explicitly(Perform forcefully type casting that more chances to data losses).

int x = 10;
double = x;

double ref = (int) 10.55;

8.What is data truncation?

losses of data while type casting the larger size data into lower size of data types.
